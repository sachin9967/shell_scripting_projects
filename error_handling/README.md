## 📌 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed and accessible:

- 🐧 Ubuntu-based OS
- 🐳 Docker
- 🔧 Docker Compose
- 🌐 Nginx
- 🐙 Git

You can manually install them using:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose nginx git
````

---

## ⚙️ Script Overview

### 🔄 1. Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachin9967/django-notes-app.git
```

If the repo already exists, the script will just `cd` into it.

---

### 📦 2. Installing Requirements

Installs:

* Docker
* Nginx
* Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker.io nginx -y docker compose
```

---

### 🔁 3. Restarting Essential Services

Changes Docker socket ownership and includes optional service restart commands:

```bash
sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock
```

> You can uncomment `systemctl` lines to enable Docker and Nginx on startup.

---

### 🚀 4. Deploying the Application

* Builds the Docker image
* Brings up containers using `docker-compose`

```bash
docker build -t notes-app .
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Script

Make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

---

## ✅ Success Message

If all steps complete without error, you'll see:

```bash
deployment done
```

---

## ❌ Error Handling

If any step fails, the script will:

* Print a helpful message
* Exit immediately

✅ **Future Improvements**:

* Add email alerts for deployment failure
* Enable detailed logging
* Make script fully idempotent
